Vassili ‘BEAR’ Vladislav was born on the Novyy Moskva Station orbiting Luna in the Sol system. While the station was relatively poor and had little access to education, Vassili was in training to become a physician like his father. He was abruptly drafted into the Great War to fight the separatists. His parents died in the station’s siege, and his brother was Killed in Action. In the Novy Moskva Army his medical skills were rare, and as such he served as a Combat Medic and operated a Search and Rescue Mech, where he developed his skills as a Lancer.
