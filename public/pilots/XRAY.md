While her record is crystal clean, our instructors took note that CDT WILLIAMS possessed difficulty making lasting relationships with her classmates, a deep concern that we were unable to iron out by her final year. ADM BERNARD WILLIAMS of the UNS-CV HORIZON TWILIGHT has filed a direct order that after graduation, CDT WILLIAMS will be posted to the RIO GRANDE under the command of CAPTAIN FARRIS. ADM WILLIAMS has informed the Academy Administration that CDT WILLIAMS' appeal against this order has been preemptively DENIED.&gt;&gt;</em></p></blockquote><hr><hr>
