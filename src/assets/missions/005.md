## SPLIT-KNUCKLE HAYMAKER

You find yourself at a crossroads. The Governor's Farm is there for you to attack directly at any moment and put a stop to Beggar One. However Commander Ilyr Ordo and Terror remind you of the danger of the weapon Beggar One unleashed upon Daylight and the dangers it presents to Mycol Fields and any large scale attack on EVERGREEN. An orbital weapon of that scale presents an existential threat to the survival of the HUC and its inhabitants. Preparation will be key.

# Goals

- Defeat Beggar One.

# Stakes

- If this mission fails, Evergreen will remain occupied  and  the  extermination  of  the local  population  will  begin.

# Rewards

- The  immediate  safety  of  the  colony,  a major  victory  against  the  Machine,  and countless  lives  saved.  Union,  Landmark Colonial, or the PCs patron will grant them sufficient  resources  to  advance  to  LL6.

# Reserves

- Ammo crates: Once while resting, spend this reserve to restore 1 charge for your entire party's LIMITED systems and weapons.
- Extra Repairs: Supplies that give a mech +2 Repair Cap.
