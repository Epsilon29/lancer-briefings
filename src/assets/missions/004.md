## Last Castle

Brava Hadura outlines the situation: At best, the colony has abandoned the refugees outside the walls. At worst, it views them not simply as a liability, but as an active and growing threat to security. She is unable to act directly in her capacity as militia commander, but with the broad emergency powers granted to the PCs by Patience and their status as freelancers, they can certainly assist. She asks the PCs to aid the refugees in whatever way they can. In return, she promises to requisition licenses and resources for them, along with anything else she can slide under the table.

# Goals

- Aid  the  refugee  camp  outside  of Evergreen  in  any  ways  possible.

# Stakes

- Without  aid  or  anyone  to  advocate  for them,  the  refugees  will  be  slaughtered  or captured  when  the  Machine  arrives  at the  city.

# Rewards

- Brava Hadura puts  aside  a cache with sufficient license information, resources, and upgrades  for  the PCs  to  progress  to LL4. The PCs  also have the opportunity  to pick  up OPPORTUNITY  and  MARKEY’S  FUSEBOX  as EXOTIC  GEAR, and reserves  in the form  of both the  Châus  and  a cache  of explosives.

# Reserves
