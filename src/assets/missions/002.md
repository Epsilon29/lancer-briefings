## Daybreak

# Goals

- Neutralize the enemyâ€™s comms jamming network, then locate and secure Captain Farris and Ambassador Bannerjee.

# Stakes

- If the players fail to neutralize the enemy jamming network on schedule, the LSA advance into Nov Elysia's central district will face heavy resistance, incurring serious casualties which may hinder their ability to retake the city effectively. Should they then fail to locate and secure Captain Farris and Ambassador Bannerjee, it will likely result in them being taken prisoner or even killed.
