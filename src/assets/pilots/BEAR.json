Despite this, they are some of the most stable NHP clones. Leading subjectivity theorists suggest that the wide portfolio of control and sense of domination given to TLALOC units encourages a sense of contentment with their work and subjectivity parameters – as a result, they have a much longer cascade window.

An initial beam flash-vaporizes the target’s outer layer and the plasma bloom is instantly analyzed for material density and structural composition, following which the needlebeam fires a focused, highintensity pulsed beam tuned to defeat heavy armor. Performance against softer targets is significantly reduced, however, as excessive material ablation disrupts the secondary beam before an optimal effect can be achieved.","customDamageType":null,"maxUseOverride":0,"uses":0,"selectedProfile":0}}],"extra":[],"bonus_effects":[]}],"integratedMounts":[],"improved_armament":{"mount_type":"Flex","lock":false,"slots":[{"size":"Flex","weapon":null}],"extra":[{"size":"Auxiliary","weapon":null}],"bonus_effects":[]},"integratedWeapon":{"mount_type":"Aux","lock":false,"slots":[{"size":"Auxiliary","weapon":null}],"extra":[],"bonus_effects":[]}}],"active_loadout_index":0}],"cc_ver":"","special_equipment":{"PilotGear":[],"Frames":[],"MechWeapons":["mw_exo_steelpunch_heavy_needlebeam","mw_exo_brood_siblings_molt"],"WeaponMods":[],"MechSystems":[],"SystemMods":[]},"combat_history":{"moves":0,"kills":0,"damage":0,"hp_damage":0,"structure_damage":0,"overshield":0,"heat_damage":0,"reactor_damage":0,"overcharge_uses":0,"core_uses":0},"state":{"active_mech_id":"89f36e54-038b-4b1f-8d7d-9a4c299f7961","remote_mech_id":"","stage":"Narrative","turn":1,"mission":0,"actions":2,"braced":false,"overcharged":false,"prepare":false,"bracedCooldown":false,"redundant":false,"stats":{"moves":0,"kills":0,"damage":0,"hp_damage":0,"structure_damage":0,"overshield":0,"heat_damage":0,"reactor_damage":0,"overcharge_uses":0,"core_uses":0},"deployed":[]},"lastModified":"Sun Oct 09 2022 18:18:43 GMT-0400 (heure d’été de l’Est)","lastUpdate_cloud":"Sun Oct 09 2022 18:18:43 GMT-0400 (heure d’été de l’Est)","lastSync":"Sun Oct 09 2022 18:18:43 GMT-0400 (heure d’été de l’Est)","shareCode":"","shareCodeExpiry":"","isRemoteResource":true,"remoteIID":"us-east-1:ae8d5767-616e-4cc4-8f1d-0a4f65f8f5a0","remoteKey":"pilot/Vassili Vladislav--89b50b48-8dab-4406-9ebe-ae46ac2b6d23--active","skills":[{"id":"Befriend","rank":3,"custom":true,"custom_desc":"Develop a friendship with someone.","custom_detail":""},{"id":"sk_lead_or_inspire","rank":2},{"id":"Negotiate","rank":2,"custom":true,"custom_desc":"Engage in strategic discussion that resolves an issue in a way that both parties find acceptable.","custom_detail":""},{"id":"sk_patch","rank":2}],"talents":[{"id":"t_gunslinger","rank":3},{"id":"t_grease_monkey","rank":2},{"id":"t_skirmisher","rank":2},{"id":"t_ace","rank":1}],"mechSkills":[3,0,0,4],"counter_data":[{"id":"ctr_gunslinger","name":"Gunslinger Die","level":3,"default_value":6,"min":1,"max":6}],"custom_counters":[],"core_bonuses":["cb_all_theater_movement_suite"],"licenses":[{"id":"mf_monarch","rank":3},{"id":"mf_sherman","rank":2}],"reserves":[],"orgs":[],"bondId":"ktb-bond-titan","xp":3,"stress":1,"burdens":[],"bondPowers":[{"name":"Nerve","description":"The first time you take any amount of Stress in a session, ignore it."},{"name":"Absolute Meat","description":"If you concentrate and grit your teeth, your personal strength verges on superhuman.
