After the emergency crash landing and first contact with hostiles, the Los Alamos Squad began the treacherous journey towards FOB Saber. On the way there they encountered civilians stuck on their way to a defense shelter being escorted by a small contingent of LSA soldiers. The Lancers helped to escort the civilians but despite their best efforts to avoid contact with the enemy they were soon spotted and combat ensued. Deespite having to escort and protect civilians the squad managed to complete their objective with minimal damage. The civilians and soldiers were incredibly thankful and provided the squad with some helpful information on the layout of the city to aid in their joruney to FOB Saber.

After departing the shelter, the squad encountered their next target, an Anti-Air Battery.
