The Los Alamos Squad was tasked with overwhelming an enemy defensive position for long enough for Rio, The USS Rio Grande Ship NHP, to upload a code-spike into a nearby comms-network transmitter. This will neutralize the communications jamming that has allowed the enemy to spread chaos amongst our ranks and allow all our units to push back the Vestan invasion of Nov Elysia.

After a hard fought skirmish, the squad managed to come out of the encounter with little to no damage. As the code spike runs amok across the enemy comms network the previous comms silence is suddenly overwhelmed as a cacophany of signals explodes. Amongst the incoming signals a few stand out:

“This is Sergeant Callas to, ah, Union command 
vessel. My squad has just secured the Hall of 
Consuls and we have no sign of either principal 
here. We’re checking with all defense shelters in the 
area to see if they were evacuated to one of them, 
but so far we’ve heard nothing–”

Rio then comes across the Union channels:

“I’ve got a signal from the captain’s ontologic 
implants! She’s moving fast, heading toward what 
looks like a port facility. Belay the rendezvous, I’ve 
got a dropship inbound for your location – get 
aboard and follow that signal!”
