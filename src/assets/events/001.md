LANDFALL
Landmark Colonial Transport Carrier
2.20.5014u

Distress call received 2 Standard Months ago from **EVERGREEN**, a colony on the planet **HERCYNIA** in the **ATLAS** line, seeking aid against unidentified aggressors.

**EVERGREEN** is under the administration of a subsidiary of **LANDMARK COLONIAL**. First objective is to make contact with local LC Representative and integrate into local hierarchy.

Situation on-ground is to be treated with utmost care. Recent investigation suggests possibility of extant human populations on **HERCYNIA** unreported by local administration. **Crisis Red** is advised not to reveal these suspisions to local personnel unless deemed necessary.

Further research has yielded little information about **HERCYNIA**â€™s history prior to founding of **EVERGREEN**. Data suggests **HERCYNIA** was once subject to widespread and catastrophic military action by **SECCOM**, though records lack meaningful detail. Recent scans show large irradiated zones on planetary surface, as well as decayed and encrypted communications broadcasting on-loop. **Crisis Red** should expect to encounter remnants of **SECCOM** presence: unexploded ordinance, waste radiation, and potentially even derelict military installations.
