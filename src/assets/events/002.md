On the way down to the planet Los Alamos squad came under fire from Anti-Air measures from the enemy. Shortly after their dropship suffered catastrophic damage to its engines from a direct hit from enemy fire. After a emergency crash landing a survey of the crash found both pilots dead, the squad far off course from the intended Drop Zone, intense comms jamming and sounds of the enemy drawing closer. Following their training the squad prepared to holdout the enemy assault and secure an exit path safe from enemy fire. Despite the best efforts of the enemy the Los Alamos squad held their ground as they prepare for the dangerous path towards FOB: SABER.
